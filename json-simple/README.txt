   Demo of a Spring MVC with JSON view. The simplest way to run the demo is using
   embedded tomcat, run following maven goals:
   
   mvn package tomcat:run
   
   Go to http://localhost:8080/json-simple/home to see standard hello world page with 
   server time generated by Spring MVC template, and then try 
   http://localhost:8080/json-simple/home.json to see the corresponding JSON view of the
   page
